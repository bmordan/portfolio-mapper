            | Papper can help you map competencies across your apprentices portfolios. You will need to have your apprentices create a master portfolio in a Google doc and have them share it with you. Grab the fileId (I'll explain later) and then add comments their work with tags that you will define indicating when they have a valid piece of evidence for a competency in the standard. This tool gives you an overview of all your apprentices organised by cohort, and their progress to 100% coverage of the standard.
