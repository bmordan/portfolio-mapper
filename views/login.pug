            | Portfolio mapper (Pappa) can help you. You will need to have your apprentices create their portfolios in a google doc on google drive and have them share it with you. Grab the fileId (I'll explain later) and then annotate their work indicating when they have a valid piece of evidence for a competency in the standard. This tool gives you an overview of all your cohorts, all your apprentices and their progress to EPA gateway.
